There’s a cacophony of slamming metal doors, keys jangling, and shouts and screams from inmates as officers race to see what’s happened. We run behind as they head to where the trouble is. Cell doors and chipped painted white bars are just about the only scenery as we move through this chaotic and nerve-jangling environment. A muffled walkie-talkie tells us it’s a case of self-harm. An inmate who’s been locked up for most of the day has carved “mum and dad” into his arm with a sharp object. A quick glance into the cell and the sight of blood. A prison officer crouches down, stemming the flow.\n",

            "The BBC has been given rare access to HMP Pentonville men's prison in north London at a time of major crisis for jails in England and Wales. Next week, with prisons across the country running out of cells for new inmates, the government will release some offenders early in a controversial scheme aimed at easing the overwhelming pressure on a system on the brink of collapse. Over the course of two days inside Pentonville this week, we were confronted with the stark reality of this crisis.\n",

            "The pressure on staff is immense. In just half a day, we hear six alarms. The day before there were more than 30. Prison officers don’t know what they’re running towards behind those locked and bolted doors. Blood, violence or even death are all possibilities. Shay Dhury has been a prison officer here for almost five years and says she’s never seen it this bad. Recently, both her wrists were broken as she tried to separate two gang members during a fight. She believes gang-related crime is one of the main reasons there are so many people in prisons, especially Pentonville. “They go for each other - and when two people go, other people go,” she says. “It ends up us just trying to stop the fight. It gets really messy sometimes - stressful, yeah.”\n",

            "HMP Pentonville was built in 1842 and is largely unchanged structurally in 180 years. Originally designed to hold 520 people in single cells, it now has an operational capacity of 1,205, with two prisoners packed into each cell. The jail is dangerously close to capacity - with just nine beds remaining when we are there. And humans are not the only inmates here: mice and cockroaches are rife. The government says Pentonville epitomises the challenges facing ageing, inner-city prisons with transient populations who have varied and complex needs. More than 80% of Pentonville inmates are on remand, which means they are awaiting trial. The rest have been convicted of serious crimes including murder, rape, and drug offences. Remand is at a 50-year high across England and Wales - and that’s partly down to a backlog in the criminal courts. Ministry of Justice (MoJ) figures show the Crown Court system has a backlog of more than 60,000 cases. The Magistrates Court has a backlog of more than 300,000 cases.\n",

A bunk bed takes up most of the space. The toilet, in the corner beside the sink, is leaking and there are wet splashes on the floor. “I've been telling them about that for three weeks,” Tom says. “I could fix it - I'm actually a plumber - but it had no washers in there.” Overcrowding impacts all areas of life inside. With fewer officers to inmates, prisoners’ needs can’t always be met, which means some, like Tom, are living in cells that aren’t properly operational for several weeks when repairs are needed.\n",

The staff seem to be doing what they can in very difficult circumstances, fighting problems, crises, and violence - but they are often struggling to cope. Sixteen people will be released from here next week when the government releases thousands of offenders early. The prison’s governor, Simon Drysdale, says that will alleviate some of the pressure and mean more people who’ve been sent to Pentonville - a reception prison serving all London courts - can be transferred on to other jails because they too will have more available cells. “Our total focus is on making sure that we've got space and capacity,” Mr Drysdale says. “That takes up a large proportion of our thinking space and a lot of the staff's time, and because of that we don't get as much time as we would like to think about things like getting men into more meaningful work.” But some Pentonville inmates are doubtful that 16 inmates being released from here will make a difference.

            "There is a \"moral imperative\" to stop the gangs helping people get to the UK in small boats, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has said ahead of a meeting with ministers, intelligence agencies and law enforcement bodies. The summit takes place three days after 12 people, including six children and a pregnant woman, died trying to make the dangerous journey across the English Channel. The disaster is the deadliest loss of life in the waterway this year. Earlier this week, Conservative shadow home secretary James Cleverly said it was \"not enough to talk about 'smashing the gangs' when the real-life consequences are so serious\". Ms Cooper said people had been \"packed into an unsafe boat which literally collapsed in the water\" adding: \"We will not rest until these networks have been dismantled and brought to justice.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "This year so far, more than 21,000 people have made the crossing - slightly higher than at the same time last year but 20% lower than in 2022. Having scrapped the previous Conservative government's Rwanda plan, aimed at curbing the number of crossings, Labour will come under pressure to demonstrate that its own approach is working. The government has pledged to focus on stopping smuggling gangs. Mr Cleverly said Labour should re-establish the Rwanda policy \"to stop vulnerable people being exploited and secure our border\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Friday's meeting to discuss small boat crossings will be attended by Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood, Attorney General Lord Hermer and representatives from the National Crime Agency (NCA), Border Forces and Crown Prosecution Service. Graeme Biggar, head of the NCA, is expected to tell the attendees that in recent weeks, co-operation with Bulgaria has led to more than 40 small boats and engines being seized, which could have been used to transport 2,400 people across the Channel. The NCA says more than 410 small boats and engines have been seized since last spring. Mr Biggar will also set out the details of 70 other ongoing investigations including raids of warehouses in Libya, where migrants were being held. The summit will look at analysis of the operational capabilities of the criminal smuggling gangs. The Home Office had promised a \"rapid\" recruitment of a border security command chief to target the gangs, however no appointment has yet been announced. Downing Street says it will be confirmed \"in the next few weeks\". Ms Cooper said the last two months had seen \"encouraging progress, with significant seizures of boats and equipment in Europe\". \"But there is work to do,\" she added, \"and the Border Security Command will bring all the relevant bodies together to investigate, arrest and prosecute these networks, as well as deepen our ties with key international partners. \"At the same time, we are swiftly removing those with no right to be in the UK, which will ensure we have a fair, firm and functioning asylum system where the rules are respected and enforced.\"\n",

Each of them has their children by their side. None seems to have any belongings. Buthaina and her six children fled el-Fasher, a besieged city in the Darfur region of Sudan, more than 480km (300 miles) away, when food and drink ran out. “We left with nothing, we just ran for our lives,” Buthaina tells the BBC. “We didn’t want to leave - my children were top of their class at school and we had a good life at home.” Sudan's civil war began in April last year when the army (SAF) and the their former paramilitary allies, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), began a vicious struggle for power, in part over proposals to move towards civilian rule. The war, which shows no signs of ending, has claimed thousands of lives, displaced millions of people and plunged parts of the country into famine. And aid agencies warn Sudan could soon experience the worst famine of anywhere in the world unless significantly more help arrives. The BBC saw the desperation of Sudanese people first-hand when we visited camps in Adré, on the country’s western border, and Port Sudan, which is the country’s main aid hub, 1,600km away on the east coast.\n",

Until last month, the crossing had been closed since January with only a few aid lorries making it into the country. It has since reopened but aid agencies fear the deliveries now getting in could be too little, too late. Every day, dozens of Sudanese refugees cross the border into Chad - many of them women carrying their hungry and thirsty children on their backs. The moment they arrive, they rush to a water tank set up by the World Food Programme (WFP), one of many UN agencies that have been trying to raise the alarm over the scale of the conflict’s humanitarian impact. After reaching Adré, we make our way to a makeshift camp near the border that has been assembled by refugees, with bits of wood, cloth and plastic. Rain begins to fall. As we leave, it turns torrential and I ask whether the precarious shelters survive the downpours. “They don’t,” says our guide Ying Hu, associate reporting officer from the UNHCR, another UN agency - for refugees. “With rainfall comes a whole set of diseases,” he adds, “and the worst part is it also means at times it can take days before we can return here by car, because of the flooding, and that means aid can’t reach here either.”\n",

The WFP says it delivered more than 200,000 tonnes of food between April 2023 and July 2024 - far less than needed - but both sides are accused of blocking deliveries into areas under rival control. The RSF and other militias have been accused of stealing and damaging deliveries, while the SAF has been accused of blocking deliveries into areas under RSF control, including most of Darfur. The BBC approached the RSF and the SAF about the accusations but has not had a response. Both factions have previously denied impeding the delivery of humanitarian relief. A single convoy of aid trucks can wait six weeks or more in Port Sudan before being cleared by the SAF for onward travel. On 15 August, the SAF agreed to allow aid agencies to resume shipments via Adré, which should provide much-needed help to the population in Darfur. In May, Human Rights Watch said ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity have been committed against ethnic Massalit and non-Arab communities in part of Darfur by the RSF and its Arab allies.

One of the women, who the BBC is not naming, says she was captured with her two-year-old son as she was fleeing Omdurman, near the capital, Khartoum. “Every day they would take my son to a room down the hallway, and I would hear him cry as they raped me,” she told me. “It happened so frequently that I would try to focus on his cry as they did it.” Also at the camp I meet Safaa, a mother of six who fled Omdurman too. Asked where her husband is, she says he stayed behind because the RSF targets any man who attempts to escape. “Every day my children ask me, 'Where is Baba? When will he come?'

            "More than 90 private tutors in the UK have been convicted of sexual offences involving children over the past 20 years, the BBC has found. The children’s commissioner for England is now calling - in light of our findings - for reform of the system, which doesn't require people offering private lessons to be checked before working with young people. Dame Rachel de Souza says private tutors should undergo the same checks as teachers. Research published in 2023 by the educational charity, the Sutton Trust, suggested that 30% of 11–16-year-olds in the UK had received private tutoring at some point.\n",

            "Jane (not her real name) found out that the man who had tutored her daughter had touched her sexually. He had been tutoring her and a number of other children in his own home for several years. Jane only found out after her daughter finally broke down and told her. She felt she had failed as a parent in the most basic duty of keeping her child safe: “It was one of those ‘bottom falling out of your world’ moments.” “I guess I kind of assumed there was some sort of protection in place,” says Jane. Teachers in schools must undergo what are known as enhanced DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) background checks. These reveal details of any spent or unspent convictions, cautions, reprimands and warnings held on the Police National Computer. However, there is no legal obligation for private tutors to undergo any background checks or be qualified to teach. The Tutors Association, which represents more than 50,000 tutors across the UK, does require all its members to have enhanced DBS checks and follow a strict code of conduct. But its president, John Nichols, says the current legal situation can’t be allowed to continue: “Anyone could call themselves a tutor, in any subject, and advertise themselves as such, regardless of their suitability.” Mr Nichols says he has written to the Secretary of State for Education, Bridget Phillipson, to ask that DBS checks become mandatory for anyone seeking to operate as a professional tutor. Unless a tutor is registered with an agency requiring background checks, parents have no easy way to check if they have previous convictions. One mother told us she had been advised to go to her local police station to consult the Sex Offenders’ Register.\n",

The figures were obtained by combing through newspaper reports and court filings. They are likely to be an underestimate. Men such as Thomas Rodgers, a music tutor who was found guilty of abusing two boys aged under 11. Rodgers was convicted in December 2023 at Snaresbrook Crown Court in East London, but continued to offer private music lessons until he was given a four-year prison sentence in January 2024 (later reduced to two years). Under the current law, Rodgers could offer tutoring on his release from prison, with no obligation to undergo checks. George (not his real name) was one of the boys abused by Rodgers. He is now an adult, and is appalled that Rodgers might be able to tutor children in the future and that parents may not know about his background. “He's never admitted what he's done. He's been in complete denial.” “They can literally open up a door and send their kid in with someone that's done these horrific crimes. It's just insane,” he says.

            "The Mercury Prize, given to the best British or Irish album of the year, comes with a cash prize of £25,000. Aside from English Teacher, this year's nominees included pop star Charli XCX with her club-centric, headline-grabbing Brat album; indie newcomers The Last Dinner Party for their debut Prelude To Ecstasy; Scottish dance act Barry Can't Swim; and East London rapper Ghetts. Eight of the shortlisted albums were debuts, including the first solo album by Beth Gibbons, who won the prize 29 years ago as part of Portishead. This year’s ceremony was held at the world-famous Abbey Road Studios in London and broadcast live on BBC Four and Radio 6 Music. The show typically takes the form of a live concert, featuring performances from each of the nominated acts, but it was scaled back after the prize lost its sponsor, the taxi company Freenow. \"Despite efforts to match up with a suitable new partner, in what is clearly a tough arts funding environment, we weren’t able to secure one within the timeframe,\" said Dr Jo Twist, chief executive of the BPI, which organises the award.

Work to replace the bridge between Manchester and Leeds on the M62 in Castleton, near Rochdale, has begun and will see part of the road shut from 21:00 BST on Friday until 06:00 on Monday. The road closure to install the bridge \"could not be avoided\", Network Rail said, with it being repeated between 20 and 23 September.

Concrete peckers will be used to take the old bridge away before the debris is removed and the new bridge will be wheeled down the motorway and fitted into place. Olivia Boland from Network Rail said workers began by removing a motorway embankment: \"We've had to complete a major earthworks scheme and build a new road to motorway specification which will take the weight of all our machinery.\" She told BBC Radio Manchester: \"Before demolition, we put thick pieces of wood down on the carriageway to protect the road surface. \"We then use four concrete-pecking machines to ensure that we're not going to have a major catastrophic collapse. \"After demolition, we then use remote control vehicles to lift the bridge up, wheel it down the motorway and fix it into its final position.\"\n",

            "Telegram founder and CEO Pavel Durov has hit out at French authorities, calling his arrest last week in relation to allegations of insufficient moderation on the messaging app \"misguided\". In his first public statement since he was detained, he denied claims that Telegram is \"some sort of anarchic paradise\" as \"absolutely untrue\". Mr Durov was arrested on 25 August at an airport north of Paris and has since been charged over suspected complicity in allowing illicit transactions, drug trafficking, fraud and the spread of child sex abuse images to flourish on his site.\n",
            "\n",
            "In Mr Durov's statement, which he published on Telegram, he said holding him responsible for crimes committed by third parties on the platform was both a \"surprising\" and \"misguided approach\". \"If a country is unhappy with an Internet service, the established practice is to start a legal action against the service itself,\" the Russian-born billionaire, who is also a French national, said. \"Using laws from the pre-smartphone era to charge a CEO with crimes committed by third parties on the platform he manages is a misguided approach.\" \"Building technology is hard enough as it is. No innovator will ever build new tools if they know they can be personally held responsible for potential abuse of those tools,\" he added. While he conceded that Telegram was not perfect, he said French authorities had several ways to get in touch with him and with Telegram, and that the app has an official representative in the EU. \"The claims in some media that Telegram is some sort of anarchic paradise are absolutely untrue. We take down millions of harmful posts and channels every day,\" he insisted. Telegram allows groups of up to 200,000 members, which critics have argued makes it easier for misinformation to spread, and for users to share conspiracist, neo-Nazi, paedophilic, or terror-related content. Recently in the UK, the app has been scrutinised for hosting far-right channels that were instrumental in organising violent disorder in English cities last month. Telegram did remove some groups, however cybersecurity experts say overall its system of moderating extremist and illegal content is significantly weaker than that of other social media companies and messenger apps.\n",

            "BBC Tenby is a popular destination in Pembrokeshire where the number of second homes is up since owners saw their council tax bill triple\n",
            "\n",
            "The number of second homes for sale in a Welsh county has trebled since council tax increased by 200%. There were 135 Pembrokeshire second homes on the market in July, compared to 38 the previous year, latest figures indicate. An estate agent said houses were going on to the market at the highest rate this century, and it was damaging the tourism industry. However, campaigners pointed to the seaside town of Newport, where 30% of properties are second homes, and called for a legal act to give locals the right to buy.\n",
            "\n",
            "New rules were introduced by the Welsh government with the aim of making it easier for people to afford homes in the area where they grew up. To help achieve this, powers were given to local authorities to charge a premium of up to 300% on top of the normal council tax rate for those who own a second home in Wales. It has become a thorny issue, especially in coastal areas and beauty spots along the west coast. Cyngor Gwynedd has long been accused of \"playing Russian roulette\" by holiday home owners and tourism boards after it imposed a 150% premium on council tax for these properties. Earlier this year, it went a step further and announced plans for any new second homes to be subject to planning consent, with these rules coming into force on 1 September. It argued that the area faced a \"huge housing crisis\", with many young people backing the move, saying wealthy second home owners were pricing them out of the market. Other councils to charge a premium include Anglesey and Conwy, where the extra rate is 100%. This is the same as Ceredigion - however, it will rise to 150% in 2025. In Carmarthenshire, second home owners pay 50% more.\n",
            "\n",
            "But Pembrokeshire went further than them all - introducing the 200% council tax premium in April - tripling bills. Owners can avoid paying the premium for up to a year by putting their homes up for sale. The number of second homes on sale in the county as of 1 July was up by 97 in 12 months - an increase of 255%. Council figures show there are now 3,271 properties registered as second homes, down from 3,364 in 2023. Those listed as self catering holiday units have also dropped from 2,621 to 2,425.\n",

He lives in Newport, where 30% of the properties are second homes or holiday lets. \"There is a huge injustice when it comes to the housing market and we need to see some sort of property act which will ensure that the local community has a legal right to a house,\" he added.

With about 20 different languages spoken among the pupils, head teacher Fiona Booth said her staff were used to promoting a sense of \"belonging\" - but it was harder to do that during the summer holidays. \"Friday is about just kick-starting where we left off before summer, because of everybody's different experiences,\" she said. \"The things that have been streamed [on to] children's mobile devices, [on to] grown-ups' television screens - we've had no control over that. We've not been able to temper any of that. We've not been able to anchor or bring the calm in that chaos.\" Mrs Booth said some children would have family members who may have taken part in the unrest, while others were from households targeted during the violence. She is braced for some friction between pupils, but said tolerance was \"not the same as liking everybody\", and that one of the school's roles was to teach children \"how to disagree well\". \"It's about plugging back into that message and saying that the minute you put on your jumper, the minute you say this is the school you attend, what you're actually saying is, 'and I wholeheartedly uphold all of the values that St. Nicholas promotes',\" she said.\n",

The advice, which aims to give children a space to \"share any worries\" and \"tackle any misconceptions\", suggests teachers open discussions like this in the morning, so that children have the rest of the day to ask questions. Sticky notes can be a good tool to encourage children to express their emotions, it says.

She said 3,447 primary schools had registered for the event and estimated that about 550,000 children would see the assembly, which will focus on positive stories She will talk about Middlesbrough, for example, where hundreds of volunteers took part in a clean-up after cars were set alight and missiles thrown at police in August. Ms Harrison said teachers wanted a \"fresh start\" at the beginning of term. \"But equally they didn't want to ignore some of the events that have happened,\" she said. \"They wanted it to be addressed in some way. Hopefully we will do that for them and help them.\"\n",

            "\n",
            "Under the scorching sun on Italy’s Adriatic coast, a group of friends from Bangladesh are practising their cricket skills on a small patch of concrete. They are playing on the outskirts of Monfalcone, close to Trieste airport, because they have in effect been banned by the mayor from playing in the town itself. They say those who try can face fines of up to €100 (£84). “If we were playing inside Monfalcone, the police would have already got here to stop us,” says team captain Miah Bappy. He points to a group of Bengali teenagers who got “caught” playing their national sport at the local park. Unaware they were being filmed by security cameras, their game was broken up by a police patrol who gave them a fine. “They say cricket is not for Italy. But I’ll tell you the truth: it’s because we are foreigners,\" Miah says. The ban on cricket has come to symbolise the deep-seated tensions that are flaring up in Monfalcone. The town has an ethnic make-up unique in Italy: of a population of just over 30,000, nearly a third are foreigners. Most of them are Bangladeshi Muslims who began to arrive in the late 1990s to build giant cruise-ships. As a consequence the cultural essence of Monfalcone is in danger, according to mayor Anna Maria Cisint, who belongs to the far-right League party. She swept to power on the back of anti-immigration sentiment - and has gone on a mission to “protect” her town and defend Christian values.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Our history is being erased,” she tells me. “It’s like it doesn’t matter anymore. Everything is changing for the worse.” In Monfalcone, Italians in Western clothes mingle with Bangladeshis wearing shalwar kameez and hijabs. There are Bangladeshi restaurants and halal shops, and a network of cycle paths mostly used by the South Asian community. In her two terms in office, Ms Cisint has removed the benches in the town square where Bangladeshis used to sit and railed against what Muslim women wear at the beach. “There’s a very strong process of Islamic fundamentalism here,\" she says. \"A culture where women are treated very badly and oppressed by men.” When it comes to her ban on cricket, the mayor claims there is no space or money to build a new pitch and says cricket balls pose a danger. She told the BBC she refuses to grant the Bangladeshis the privilege to play their national sport - and claims they offer “nothing in return”. “They’ve given nothing to this city, to our community. Zero,” she says. “They are free to go and play cricket anywhere else… outside of Monfalcone.”\n",

            "The mayor has received death threats because of her views on Muslims - and that’s why she’s now under 24-hour police protection. Miah Bappy and his fellow cricketers have moved to Italy to build ships at the Fincantieri shipyard – the biggest in Europe, and one of the largest in the world. The mayor accuses the company of “wage dumping” - the practice of paying wages below the market level, often to foreign workers - arguing that its salaries are so low no Italian would want to do the work for the same money. But the director of the shipyard Cristiano Bazzarra is adamant that salaries paid by the company and its contractors are aligned with Italian law. “We are not able to find trained workers. In Europe it’s very difficult to find young people who want to work in a shipyard,” he tells me. Italy has among the lowest birth rates in Europe. Last year only 379,000 babies were born in Italy with an average of 1.2 children per woman. Italy is also facing labour shortages and researchers estimate Italy will require 280,000 foreign workers a year until 2050 to make up for a shrinking work force.\n",

            "Anna Maria Cisint was elected mayor of Monfalcone in 2016\n",
            "\n",
            "Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who leads the far-right Brothers of Italy, has increased the number of permits for non-EU workers despite previously saying she wanted to reduce immigration. But Anna Maria Cisint firmly believes that the way of life of the Bangladeshi Muslim community is “incompatible” with the life of native-born Italians. In Monfalcone, the tensions came to a head when the mayor in effect banned collective prayer at the two Islamic centres in the town. “People from the town started sending me shocking photos and videos which showed a huge number of people praying in the two Islamic centres: as many as 1,900 in just one building,” the mayor says. “There are so many bikes left on the pavement, and loud prayers five times a day - even at night.” Mayor Cisint says this was unfair to local residents - and argues her ban on collective prayer comes down to an issue of urban planning regulations. The Islamic centres are not designated for religious worship, and she says it’s not her job to provide them. Islam is not among the 13 religions that have official status under Italian law, which complicates efforts to build places of worship. Bangladeshis in Monfalcone say the mayor’s decision has had an enormous impact on the Muslim community. “The mayor thinks that Bengalis are trying to Islamify Italy - but we are just minding our own business,” says 19-year-old Meheli. She’s originally from Dhaka in Bangladesh but grew up in Italy, wears Western clothes and speaks fluent Italian. She says she has been sworn at and harassed in the street because of her Bengali heritage.\n",

He wrote the play, which revolves around the everyday life of a family-run Korean store, and starred as the son when it was first staged in Toronto in 2011. He then co-wrote the TV series, which became a hit in Canada from 2016 and found a worldwide audience after being picked up by Netflix two years later.

            "In the play, the family's proud, hard-working patriarch grapples with the changing neighbourhood and the growing divide between his first-generation immigrant values and those of his children. For instance, Appa tries to convince daughter Janet (Jennifer Kim) to take over the shop, instead of pursuing her dream of becoming a photographer. He also warns that her \"expiration date is over\", as she shows no intention to marry as a 30-year-old single woman. Listen on BBC Sounds: Kim's Convenience cast talks about 'immigrant life' While this all-Asian lead cast gives an opportunity to look into one East Asian family’s life, it also resonates with different cultures and ages, says Choi. \"In the end, it's a comedy. It's a story about a family. \"Regardless of your background, I think everyone can relate to parents who they feel they disappointed. Or if you're a parent, kids who don't appreciate you. \"So it's both sides of that dynamic.\"\n",

I was so pleasantly surprised that we now have options.\" In fact, the genesis of Kim’s Convenience stems from the lack of opportunities Choi had as a young actor. After graduating from drama school, he auditioned for many roles but kept getting rejected. Eventually, he decided to write his own story, which became his debut play - and later a Netflix hit. While he understands that directors today are looking for new Asian voices, he feels some theatre companies have quite a \"white programme\", which still makes plays like Kim’s Convenience stand out. \"I think it’s still kind of a rare thing in an English-speaking city to have an Asian-led play on stage,\" he says. \"So that's unfortunately always been one reason for interest because it’s still the unique thing to watch. \"It's a little different, not a white family's living room.

This was also the case with the TV series, and some have argued that heavy accents perpetuate stereotypes. Choi vehemently disagrees. \"Maybe producers don't want people speaking accents because they don't want to be seen as offensive. But then they're just dismissing and erasing [it], which, in my opinion, is more offensive.\" He has put both charaters centre stage, celebrating their three-dimensional personalities. \"Whether people want to admit it or not, there's a whole part of society that is unrepresented in media. For fear of backlash, they are not seen and heard,\" adds Choi. He says he is doing his best job imitating his own parents and what he grew up hearing. And he says he is, in fact, pulling back from the accent, so a \"Western ear\" can understand him better. \"When my kids watched the play, they couldn't stop laughing. They loved it. They said I was just like Halabeoji [Grandad]. And I was like, 'Thank you.'\"\n",

Choi originally played estranged son Jung, but it has now been so long since the original run that he has been playing Appa since last year. \"Going back to Soulpepper Theatre will feel almost like a physical, geographic full circle, in terms of the son becoming the parent,\" he says. He acknowledges that it was a \"strange but normal feeling\" when he first played Appa, adding that he has been \"rehearsing for the last 10 years\" to play the father, as his real-life children have grown up and he has grown into the role. \"I love the sound of Appa - it’s so warm and conjures great feelings,\" he says. \"So now, when I get called Appa by Janet and Jung, I already respond to that name.\"\n",

            "When Bis first formed they had one goal in mind. “All we dreamed of was putting out a 7 inch single,” says singer Amanda ‘Manda Rin’ McKinnon. The Scottish trio achieved a lot more highs and lows than that, from Top of the Pops and jumping in the Beastie Boys swimming pool to a hate campaign from the music press and a bitter falling out. Now the band are marking three decades together with a special anniversary gig in Glasgow on Saturday.\n",

            "“We were always regarded as the young ones, so it’s strange to think we’ve been spending 30 years doing this,” says Amanda. “I’m so happy that I’ve got friends that I can do that with. There’s so many people coming from abroad for the show – we’ve got fans coming from America, Finland, Germany and France so we feel pressure that they enjoy themselves”. Amanda and bandmate John Clark (aka John Disco) were still at Woodfarm High school in East Renfrewshire when they joined John’s older brother Steven (Sci-Fi Steven) to form Bis. Within months first single Transmissions On The Teen-C Tip arrived, combining all their interests – pop music, DIY fanzine culture, punk energy and art – into one bundle.\n",

            "Future singles built momentum for the band and then everything exploded in March 1996, when they became the first unsigned band to appear on Top of the Pops. “We were doing a joint headline tour with the Super Furry Animals,” recalls Amanda. “There were no mobile phones back then so we got this call to a venue looking for our manager and asking if we could go on Top of the Pops that week. “It aired the next day and I remember us all watching it in the Super Furries hotel room. My mum worked in a bar at the time and was delighted – she said she was pointing at the telly and showing everyone.”\n",

Amanda found herself being insulted for her looks and her weight, while the music weekly printed death threats from readers who hated the band and their twee image, which stood out during the swaggering Britpop era. “I was 19 when we did Top of the Pops and John is a year younger, so the fact NME found it a nice thing to print death threats to teenagers was just sick. “I’m amazed I got through it, because I don’t have a lot of confidence, musically or appearance wise. Being told you’re unattractive is not something any teenage girl wants to hear. If it wasn’t for the good people, maybe I wouldn’t have got through it all.” Those good people included supporters at home and abroad, from other musicians like Garbage and Pavement to a devoted fanbase.\n",

It was just weird.” However the three-piece’s greatest overseas success came in Japan, where they earned a devoted following. Two tours of the country included three sold-out nights in Tokyo. “There is nothing that compares to it here,” says Amanda. “You get off the plane and there are fans waiting at the airport. You get the bullet train, and there’s fans waiting at the station for you. They all give you presents, and they’ve put a lot of thought into them. “They launched a Bis Baby-G watch when we were out there! I’ve still got them somewhere in a box…”\n",

The road closure to install the bridge \"could not be avoided\", Network Rail said, with it being repeated between 20 and 23 September.

Concrete peckers will be used to take the old bridge away before the debris is removed and the new bridge will be wheeled down the motorway and fitted into place. Olivia Boland from Network Rail said workers began by removing a motorway embankment: \"We've had to complete a major earthworks scheme and build a new road to motorway specification which will take the weight of all our machinery.\" She told BBC Radio Manchester: \"Before demolition, we put thick pieces of wood down on the carriageway to protect the road surface. \"We then use four concrete-pecking machines to ensure that we're not going to have a major catastrophic collapse. \"After demolition, we then use remote control vehicles to lift the bridge up, wheel it down the motorway and fix it into its final position.\"\n",

            "Northern Ireland's education minister has intervened to try and prevent parents from paying tax on private school fees from January. Paul Givan said fee-paying schools were different in Northern Ireland from those in England, and should not be subject to value-added tax (VAT). The standard VAT rate of 20% will be added to private school fees from 1 January 2025, which the government says will help fund more teachers' salaries in England. About 2,500 pupils in Northern Ireland attend grammar school preps, Christian and other independent schools.\n",
            "\n",
            "Their parents face paying more for their children's education as the government plans to remove a long-standing VAT exemption for private schools and independent schools. While some famous private schools like Eton and Harrow in England charge about £50,000 a year, schools in Northern Ireland charge parents a lot less than that. Mr Givan told BBC News NI that schools in Northern Ireland could not be directly compared with many private schools in England, and the new UK-wise approach did not \"reflect how the Northern Ireland education system is funded\". While education is devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont, taxation is decided at Westminster. \"This is ultimately HMRC, it's the Treasury and I'm making the representation on behalf of schools in Northern Ireland and parents as to why they shouldn't be included,\" Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) minister Mr Givan said. \"I recognise the real concerns parents have.\" In a statement to BBC News NI a government spokesperson said: \"We want to ensure all children have the best chance in life to succeed.\" \"Ending tax breaks on private schools will help to raise the revenue needed to fund our education priorities for next year.\"\n",

            "\n",
            "The number of second homes for sale in a Welsh county has trebled since council tax increased by 200%. There were 135 Pembrokeshire second homes on the market in July, compared to 38 the previous year, latest figures indicate. An estate agent said houses were going on to the market at the highest rate this century, and it was damaging the tourism industry. However, campaigners pointed to the seaside town of Newport, where 30% of properties are second homes, and called for a legal act to give locals the right to buy.\n",
            "\n",
            "New rules were introduced by the Welsh government with the aim of making it easier for people to afford homes in the area where they grew up. To help achieve this, powers were given to local authorities to charge a premium of up to 300% on top of the normal council tax rate for those who own a second home in Wales. It has become a thorny issue, especially in coastal areas and beauty spots along the west coast. Cyngor Gwynedd has long been accused of \"playing Russian roulette\" by holiday home owners and tourism boards after it imposed a 150% premium on council tax for these properties. Earlier this year, it went a step further and announced plans for any new second homes to be subject to planning consent, with these rules coming into force on 1 September. It argued that the area faced a \"huge housing crisis\", with many young people backing the move, saying wealthy second home owners were pricing them out of the market. Other councils to charge a premium include Anglesey and Conwy, where the extra rate is 100%. This is the same as Ceredigion - however, it will rise to 150% in 2025. In Carmarthenshire, second home owners pay 50% more.\n",
            "\n",
            "But Pembrokeshire went further than them all - introducing the 200% council tax premium in April - tripling bills. Owners can avoid paying the premium for up to a year by putting their homes up for sale. The number of second homes on sale in the county as of 1 July was up by 97 in 12 months - an increase of 255%. Council figures show there are now 3,271 properties registered as second homes, down from 3,364 in 2023. Those listed as self catering holiday units have also dropped from 2,621 to 2,425.\n",
